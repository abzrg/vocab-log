    Lisa studied for three straight years and was thereby able to pass
    her test.

        (note: thereby was used at the start of the clause, rather it

-------  respect).

    - The new contract does not allow for extended maternity leave;
      *therein lies* the problem for the union, 60% of whose

    - The tomb and the contents therein, were photographed before
      analysis could begin.

    - "it shall be sufficient evidence of the facts therein contained"


thereof: of the thing just mentioned; of that. (the key is to realize
-------  what 'that' is refering to)

    - Both parties had their sights focused on the northern regions,
      especially the demographics thereof, and were preparing for an

        (the demographics of the people in the northern region)

-------

    - The affidavit did not implicitly outline wherein Mr. Smith had
      broken any laws.

      not very commonly used.

        essentially: by saying it, it is true.

    - Given the present circumstances, I hereby resign my post as CEO.
